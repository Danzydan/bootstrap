             Two Businessmen Excrete 193 Cocaine Pellets in NDLEA Custody

            <div class="accordion-body bg-dark text-white">
              <strong>Two businessmen arrested by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for cocaine ingestion at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja have excreted a total of 193 pellets of the drug after three days in observatory custody.

                A statement on Sunday by the spokesman of the anti-narcotics agency, Femi Babafemi said the traffickers: Onoh Ebere, 49, and Christian Ogbuji, 47, were intercepted at the Abuja airport last Wednesday upon their arrival from Uganda via Addis Ababa, onboard Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 951.
                
                He said though both suspects have businesses they manage in Nigeria, but alleged that their main source of income has been drug trafficking.
                
                He disclosed that they both travelled to Uganda and from there crossed over to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia where they picked the consignments before returning to Abuja with Lagos as their final destination.
                
                Babafemi said after days in excretion room, Ebere Onoh excreted a total of 100 pellets weighing 2.137 kilogrammes while Christian Ogbuji expelled 93 pellets hidden in his stomach with a gross weight of 1.986 kilogrammes.
                
                In other clampdowns, NDLEA operatives in raids of two notorious drug joints, Zaro bunk in Bama road, Sabongari and the Sani Abacha indoor stadium, both in Kano metropolis attested a total of 160 suspects with different quantities of illicit substances.
                
                Also, two suspects: Abubakar Sallau, 55, and Nazifi Abdullahi, 25, were arrested last Saturday along Kano-Maiduguri road, with 5,000 pills of tramadol 200mg, while a total of 65,200 tablets of tramadol and exol-5 were seized from the duo of Adamu Nagati, 30, and Ali Nasiru, 35. This is even as operatives in Abuja also arrested 25 suspects in raids across Tora Bora, Gwarinpa village, 3rd avenue in Gwarinpa, Karamo, Garki market, Sabongari Bwari and New Kucigoro IDP camp, within the FCT.
                
                Babafemi said another bid to smuggle into Lagos a consignment of 24 kilogrammes cannabis indica concealed in imported used cars from Canada was again frustrated by NDLEA operatives who seized the illicit substance last Thursday  during a joint 100% examination of a container marked, MSMU 7412069, at the Prime Connection Bonded terminal, off Oshodi-Apapa expressway. He noted that  two clearing agents linked with the container, Chief G.O. Njokwu and Mr. Christopher Obialor, have been arrested in collaboration with men of Customs Service.
                
                In the same vein, operatives of the Directorate of Operations and General Investigation, DOGI, attached to courier firms have intercepted a Saudi Arabia-bound 398grams of cocaine hidden in native dresses during outward clearance of goods.
                
                A female suspect, Fatima Hassan was arrested last Friday  in Lagos with 33.5 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa, while 44 kilogrammes of the same substance was recovered same day from the Lagos Island warehouse of a fleeing drug dealer.
                
                The previous day, another suspect, Peter Joseph was arrested along Lagos/ibadan expressway with 10,000 pills of tramadol 250mg and 1,500 tablets of Rohypnol concealed inside his Toyota Sienna vehicle, with registration number NRK 961XB.
                
                Similarly, a total of 68,300 pills of various opioids mainly tramadol were recovered from one Bello Usman when the truck conveying the illicit drugs was intercepted in Awka, Anambra state. In the same vein, 460,000mls of Akuskura in 7,800 bottles were seized from a dealer, Mohammed Kyari, 42, when he was arrested in Gamboru Ngala town, Borno State last Wednesday.
                
                NDLEA operatives supported by soldiers raided the hideout of a notorious drug dealer, Jimoh Lekan (aka ‘komokomo’) in Owode, Ogun state where 134 kilogrammes cannabis was recovered from his store last Thursday, their counterparts in Plateau state last Tuesday arrested a suspect Bashir Usman, 32, at the Gangare Area of Jos, with 43.951 kilogrammes of cannabis.
                
                Meanwhile, the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd) while commending the officers and men of NAIA, Tincan, Kano, FCT, Lagos, Ogun, Taraba, Borno, Plateau and Anambra Commands of the agency as well as those of DOGI for their resilience. He however urged them and their peers across the country to intensify their drug supply reduction and drug demand reduction activities.

              Presidency: Rising Inflation A Global Challenge, Not Peculiar to Nigeria
            </button>
          </h2>
          <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
            <div class="accordion-body bg-dark text-white">
              <strong>Nigeria’s  Presidency rose in stout defence of the rising inflation rate in the country, saying the menace is global, and not peculiar to Nigeria. Presidential spokesperson, Mallam Garba Shehu, said this in a statement, titled, “Re: Buhari Leaves Inflation at Highest in 17 Years.”

                The presidential assertion came as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in a report released on Tuesday, stated that most sub-Saharan African currencies had weakened against the United States dollar. IMF the situation fanned inflationary pressures across the continent as import prices surged.
                
                The presidency cited statistics from nations across the world to back its claim that the current rising inflation was a global concern worsened by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic three years ago and the Russia/Ukraine war.
                
                Shehu, while alluding to the fact that Nigeria’s current 22 per cent inflation rate was high and worrisome, however, submitted that the Buhari administration was taking serious steps to stem the global cost of living crisis.
                
                The presidency stated, “These days, the newspaper (not identified) is at its best when it comes to twisting politically sensitive facts to suit its preconceived notions.
                
                “In one of its highest fallacies, the paper this morning is tying the rise of inflation to its 17-year high to the person of the president, Muhammadu Buhari, who leaves office in exactly two weeks from this day.
                
                “Anybody who promotes this kind of thinking is telling the whole world that they either don’t know what is happening all over the world or they are not paying attention to the facts.
                
                “This stubbornly high inflation is a world-wide problem and no nation is immune to it since the global economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
                
                “Inflation was boosted everywhere by the COVID-19 lockdowns with severe impact on national economies due to the dislocation of manufacturing and supply chains.
                
                “This is what led to fewer goods and the rises in prices of those goods reaching the market.”
                
                The presidency added, “Considering that Nigeria relies heavily on imports for essential products like petroleum, cooking oils, fertilisers, crop chemicals, and others, international price fluctuations significantly impact local prices. The government, unless it chooses to disregard the principles of free trade, has limited manoeuvrability in this regard.
                
                “France, which enjoyed a stable average inflationary regime of 4.1 per cent from 1960-2022 is today reporting price increases of up to 1,080.36 per cent.
                
                “At 10.1 per cent, UK inflation is at a 41-year high. Ghana’s inflation rate had hit a two-decades high of 54.1 per cent before a recent decrease.
                
                “Turkey’s rate is 45 per cent, Pakistan has also reported an alarming high inflation rate comparable to countries with similar profiles.
                
                “The war in Ukraine meant a rocketing in foodstuff prices leading to fear of famine in many countries, never mind inflation!
                
                “While Nigeria’s reported inflation rate of 22 per cent is undoubtedly high and worrisome, it would be incorrect to suggest that the Buhari administration is not making efforts to address the volatile global cost of living crisis.
                
                “President Buhari has consistently prioritised efforts to control inflation and continues to do so.”

              Tinubu, Kwankwaso Meet in France, Ex-Kano Governor May Join Government of National Unity
            </button>

            <div class="accordion-body bg-dark text-white">
              <strong>More details have emerged on Monday’s meeting, reportedly, in Paris between President-elect Bola Tinubu and leader of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso. A House of Representatives member-elect from Kano State, Abdulmumin Jibrin, was said to be at the centre of it all.

                Although details of the meeting were still sketchy at the time of filing this report on Tuesday night, THISDAY reliably gathered that it was largely brokered by Jibril, a close associate of Kwankwaso and the first Director General of Tinubu’s presidential campaign. Jibrin had resigned from that position to join the then fledgling NNPP under which he contested and won a return to the House of Representatives in the February 25 elections. 
                
                A source, who pleaded anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the issue, said Jibrin’s relationship with both Tinubu and Kwankwaso provided him the vantage position to broker the meeting.
                
                “Yes, he was in the middle of it, don’t forget Kwankwaso is his political mentor and, of course, he was Tinubu’s first campaign DG,” the source said of Jibril. “So, he was able to broker rapprochement between them after some calls back and forth, a deal was reached that culminated in the meeting in France,” the source added.
                
                After the meeting, which some allies of the two political leaders believed to be privy to the discussions described as successful, Kwankwaso was said to have agreed to work with Tinubu and be part of his proposed Government of National Unity (GNU). 
                
                In addition, THISDAY gathered that one of the highpoints of the meeting was a proposal by Tinubu to reconcile the outgoing Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje, and Kwankwaso. The two men had fallen out about eight years ago, after Ganduje succeeded Kwankwaso.
                
                A source, who was privy to the meeting, said Kwankwaso’s wife and Jibrin accompanied the former Kano State governor to the meeting, while Tinubu’s wife and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, were also part of the meeting.
                
                The meeting, it was gathered, started about 12.30pm and ended about 4.45pm on Monday.
                
                The source said, “The president-elect and Senator Kwankwaso met for over four hours behind closed doors in Paris on Monday.
                
                “Senator Oluremi Tinubu was also there to receive Kwankwaso’s wife, Hajia Salamatu, who came with her husband.
                
                “Discussions were centered around their long term friendship since their days in the National Assembly in 1992, national unity and development, priorities for the new government, National Assembly contests, and the plan by the president-elect for a government of national unity, which Kwankwaso has in principle accepted to join.”
                
                It was gathered that Tinubu told Kwankwaso to reach out to his political associates on the need to work together, as they later agreed to hold subsequent meetings.
                
                The source revealed that Tinubu also hinted at reconciling Ganduje and Kwankwaso.
                
                Ganduje succeeded Kwankwaso in 2015, but the duo, who had been together for about 15 years, fell apart shortly after.
